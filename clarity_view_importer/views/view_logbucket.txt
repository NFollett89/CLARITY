-- This is needed because it's not posssible to natively join Log Sinks and Log Buckets 
-- because log sinks use the convention: logging.googleapis.com/projects/{$project_name}/
-- and log buckets use the convention: //logging.googleapis.com/projects/{$project_number}/
-- so this normalizes it to the log sink syntax
